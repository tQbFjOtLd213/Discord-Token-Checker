# Discord-Token-Checker
A Program that scans Discord API Tokens to see if they are working or invalid.

Before using Run "Install.bat"

Put Tokens you want to check into "tokens.txt". Make sure to save the file.

Open "Start.bat" and it will scan. This may take a while depending on the amount of tokens you want to scan.

To check to see which tokens works and which don't, Go to Output, verified.txt. They should be the ones that work. The ones that are invalid will be stored in "Invalid.txt"

Have Fun and use wisely!
